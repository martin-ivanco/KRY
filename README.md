Projects for Cryptography - One-Time Pad and RSA
# One-Time Pad and RSA
Two projects made as a part of the course Cryptography at Brno University of Technology. The task of the first project was to crack the One-Time Pad algorithm weakened by reusing the same key multiple times. The task of the second project was TODO.

## How to use
Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/photohunter9/KRY.git`
* Weakened One-Time Pad:
  1. Get the progressbar dependency using `pip install progressbar2`
  2. Run the app using `python3 otp.py <path to folder with message files>`
  3. ???
  4. Profit!
* TODO

## Dependencies
* Python 3
